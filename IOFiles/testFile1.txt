Hello, World!
I hope this works well.
What even is the end of a file?
Do files really ever end?
Who knows.

I sure don't.
One time, a long time ago, there was a man who wanted to test a program, so her wrote a very long string of characters on one line to see if there was a limit to how many a C program would process before moving on to the next line.

Well, now he has an answer.

End of File.
